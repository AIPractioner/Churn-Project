Data understanding (EDA) – a graphical and non-graphical representation of relationships between the response variable and predictor variables.

Data preparation & Feature engineering – data pre-processing – missing values, outliers, etc.

Feature Selection – how were the features selected based on the data analysis?

Modeling – selection, comparison, tuning, and analysis – consider ensembles.

Evaluation – performance measures, results, and conclusions.

Deployment - A discussion of either the hypothetical deployment of the model or the actual deployment of the model if it has been deployed.

Discussion and conclusions – address the problem statement and recommendation.

The Kaggle dataset has been copied to this repo. It is named ecommdataset
